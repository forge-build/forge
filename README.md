# Forge

Forge is an innovative initiative aimed at developing a prototype that offers declarative APIs and tooling for automating image builds on top of the Kubernetes API.

At the core of Forge are its infrastructure providers, each of which implements specific infrastructures such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and more. Complementing these are the provisioner providers, with technologies like Ansible seamlessly integrated.

With Forge, users can expect streamlined image builds, powerful automation, and convenient integrations with leading cloud platforms. Our goal is to not only build this project but also to seek inclusion in the prestigious Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Join us in this exciting journey to revolutionize image-building automation.
